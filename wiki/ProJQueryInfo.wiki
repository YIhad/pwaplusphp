#summary Details about the jQuery integration for PWA+PHP

= Introduction =

Pro v0.9.4 and up has integrated jQuery animations for paginated albums (via [http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle jQuery Cycle]) and album thumbnails also fade via JQ to reveal the album description and details.

= Conflicts =

When multiple instances of jQuery are loaded within wordpress, some [http://code.google.com/p/pwaplusphp/issues/detail?id=91 strange things can happen]. Since there's no way to detect whether JQ is loaded until _after_ all the PHP code has executed, we can't dynamically disable PWA+PHP's calls to load jQuery.

= Workaround =

You can disable PWA+PHP's jQuery calls in pwapluphp.php by removing them or commenting them out.  Here are the pertinent lines:
