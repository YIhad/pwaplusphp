#summary How to setup PWA+PHP to display Picasa Albums on your WordPress blog
#labels Deprecated

= Introduction =

PWA+PHP can be easily integrated into your WordPress blog, but it requires some code modifications.  You can [http://smccandl.net/wp/?page_id=5 see a working example here]. To simplyify the process, I've copied the files from that demo install and made them available for download in the [http://code.google.com/p/pwaplusphp/downloads/list Downloads section].

= Procedure =

  # Download the code in the [http://code.google.com/p/pwaplusphp/downloads/list Downloads section].
  # Extract the code in the root of your WP installation, one level above the wp-content directory
  # Point your browser to the install.php script to generate config.php.  You'll need the token (found in config.php) if you plan to display your private albums.
  # Follow the [http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/exec-php/ Exec-PHP install instructions] (the code is included as part of the bundle but you still need to enable it within WP)
  # Create a new page in WP and copy the contents of index.php from the bundle
  # Edit each of the following lines to suit:
{{{
$GDATA_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN";
$PICASAWEB_USER="YOUR_PWA_ID";
$action = "/wp/?page_id=12";       # Name of the page that displays galleries
}}}
  # Create a second new page in WP and copy the contents of gallery.php from the bundle
  # Edit each of the following lines to suit:
{{{
$GDATA_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN";
$PICASAWEB_USER="YOUR_PWA_ID";
$action = "/wp/?page=12";          # Name of the page that displays galleries
$back_link = "/wp/?page=5";        # Name of the file that displays all albums
}}}
  # Edit lines in lightbox CSS and javascript files to point to the correct places
   * css/lightbox.css
{{{
#prevLink:hover, #prevLink:visited:hover { background: url(/wp/wp-content/images/prevlabel.gif) left 15% no-repeat; }
#nextLink:hover, #nextLink:visited:hover { background: url(/wp/wp-content/images/nextlabel.gif) right 15% no-repeat; }
}}}
   * js/lightbox.js
{{{
fileLoadingImage:        '/wp/wp-content/images/loading.gif',
fileBottomNavCloseImage: '/wp/wp-content/images/closelabel.gif',
}}}
