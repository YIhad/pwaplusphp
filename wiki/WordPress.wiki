#summary Instructions for setting up PWA+PHP within your WordPress blog

= Introduction =

PWA+PHP can be easily integrated into your WordPress blog, but it requires some code modifications.  You can [http://smccandl.net/wp/?page=5 see a working example here]. To simplyify the process, I've copied the files from that demo install and made them available for download in the Downloads section.

in gallery.php

$GDATA_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN";
$PICASAWEB_USER="YOUR_PWA_ID";

$action = "/wp/?page=12";          # Name of the page that displays galleries
$back_link = "/wp/?page=5";       # Name of the file that displays all albums

in index.php

$GDATA_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN";
$PICASAWEB_USER="YOUR_PWA_ID";
$action = "/wp/?page_id=12";       # Name of the page that displays galleries

in css/lightbox.css

#prevLink:hover, #prevLink:visited:hover { background: url(/wp/wp-content/images/prevlabel.gif) left 15% no-repeat; }
#nextLink:hover, #nextLink:visited:hover { background: url(/wp/wp-content/images/nextlabel.gif) right 15% no-repeat; }

in js/lightbox.js

fileLoadingImage:        '/wp/wp-content/images/loading.gif',
fileBottomNavCloseImage: '/wp/wp-content/images/closelabel.gif',
