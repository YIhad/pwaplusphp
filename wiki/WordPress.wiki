= Introduction =

PWA+PHP can be easily integrated into your WordPress blog, but it requires some code modifications.  You can [http://smccandl.net/wp/?page_id=5 see a working example here]. To simplyify the process, I've copied the files from that demo install and made them available for download in the Downloads section.

= Procedure =

  # Download the code in the Downloads section.
  # Extract the code in the root of your WP installation, one level above the wp-content directory
  # Follow the [http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/exec-php/ Exec-PHP install instructions] (the code is included as part of the bundle but you still need to enable it within WP)
  # Create a new page in WP and copy the contents of index.php from the bundle
  # Edit each of the following lines to suit:
{{{
$GDATA_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN";
$PICASAWEB_USER="YOUR_PWA_ID";
$action = "/wp/?page_id=12";       # Name of the page that displays galleries
}}}
  # Create a second new page in WP and copy the contents of gallery.php from the bundle
  # Edit each of the following lines to suit:
{{{
$GDATA_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN";
$PICASAWEB_USER="YOUR_PWA_ID";
$action = "/wp/?page=12";          # Name of the page that displays galleries
$back_link = "/wp/?page=5";       # Name of the file that displays all albums
}}}
  # Edit lines in lightbox CSS and javascript files to point to the correct places

  #prevLink:hover, #prevLink:visited:hover { background: url(/wp/wp-content/images/prevlabel.gif) left 15% no-repeat; }
