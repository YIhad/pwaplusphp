||Picasaweb User||Enter your Picasaweb username. This is the username you use to login to view your albums.||

||Images Per Page||Set the number of thumbnails to display per page. Value of 0 means don't paginate.||
||Image Size||Set the display size for full images. These values are supported by the Picasaweb API.||
||Thumbnail Size||Set the thumbnail size. These values are supported by the Picasaweb API.||
||Require Filter||Set this to FALSE unless you want to *require* a search filter in the URL -- you can still filter albums with this set to FALSE. Setting to TRUE *requires* a filter string in the URL to prevent certain users from seeing certain albums.||
||Public Albums Only||This option allows you to specify whether to display only public or both public and private albums of the user specified above.||
||Album Details||Setting this to TRUE will overlay the album details on the gallery thumbnails when the user hovers the mouse over the image.||

||Show Photo Caption||This option allows you to specify whether or not captions are displayed under photos. Options are always, never, or only when the user hovers over the space below the thumbnail. Click the caption to save the image if PERMIT_IMG_DOWNLOAD is set to TRUE. Captions work best with largr thumbnail sizes.||
||Permit Image Download||This option determines whether the user can download the original full-size image by clicking on the caption under the photo. Set to TRUE to enable and FALSE to disable.||
||Show Footer Message||Setting this to true allows PWA+PHP to display a 'generated by' message at the bottom of the page, so other users can learn about it.||
