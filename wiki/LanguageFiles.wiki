#summary Language files available for PWA+PHP.

= Introduction =

Version 1.7.5 of PWA+PHP supports multiple languages via the config files below.  Download the file corresponding to the language you want to use on your site and place it in the lang/ folder.  Then, edit config.php to point to that file.  For example, for US English, the $SITE_LANGUAGE file should point to "en_us":

`$SITE_LANGUAGE="en_us";`
