#summary This page describes how to setup album filtering using keywords in the URL.

== Introduction ==

PWA+PHP allows you to display only certain albums by specifying filter text as a keyword in the URL.  This allows you to group your albums and display similar albums on the same page.  If you're embedding the code within a CMS, you can even allow certain users to view some of your albums while preventing their access to other albums.

== Procedure ==

For example, let's say you have a Picasa album called "Halloween Party" and you want to display it only to your friends.  

  * Login to PicasaWeb Albums and edit the title of this album so it reads "Halloween Party `_`Friends".
  * Provide the following URL to your friends:
    http://yoursite.com/pictures/gallery.php?filter=_Friends

When they click this link, they'll see all your albums where you've included that keyword as part of the title.

For enhanced security, you can hard-code the keyword into the gallery.php script, preventing users from specifying other keywords and gaining access to albums you don't want them to see.
