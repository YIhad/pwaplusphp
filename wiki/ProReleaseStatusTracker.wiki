==New Feature Status ==

===jQuery Pagination for Image Thumbs (in progress)===
JQ pagination implemented via [http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle jQuery Cycle Plugin], providing 28 transition styles. 
Remaining ToDo's:
    * Complete cross-browser checks, fix broken ie6 layout
    * Add hide title override in shortcode
    * ~~Graceful degrade to old pagination style where JS is disable~~ (done 3/18)
    * ~~Add settings page option for pagination style selection~~ (done 3/18)
    
===jQuery Pagination for Album Thumbs (not started)===
Similar to above item, but for the album thumbnails on the main gallery page. Must also support degradation for non-JS environments and should have option to disable for large album sets. 

===Faster Page Loads (done)===
Various changes (detailed below) have contributed to noticeably faster page loads, especially for large (300+) image albums.
    * Removed layout options within display loop, which eliminated 4 logical comparisons per image displayed.
    * Enhanced cache functionality to include XML data
    * Implemented caption hovers via JQuery vs old CSS approach
