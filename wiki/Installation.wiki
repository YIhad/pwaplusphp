#summary This page describes the installation process for PWA+PHP in both standalone and non-standalone configurations.

== Procedure For Standalone Installation ==

  * Unzip the archive you downloaded under the public_html folder on your webserver
{{{
$ tar xvf pwa+php_v1.8.3.tar
pwaplusphp/gallery.php
pwaplusphp/index.php
pwaplusphp/install.php
pwaplusphp/INSTALL.txt
pwaplusphp/LICENSE.txt
pwaplusphp/style.css
}}}
  * Point your browser to http://yoursite.com/pwaplusphp/install.php, you should see something like:
{{{
Setting up PicasaWeb tokens for site: yoursite.com
If this is correct, Login to your Google Account
}}}
  * Click the link to login and then you should see a page from google asking you to Grant or Deny access.
  * Click Grant and the token you just generated will be displayed and saved to the config file
  * Click the link to continue to the next step and set your preferences

== Additional Steps For Non-Standalone Installation ==

If you want to include this php script within another PHP code via the include() function or if you want to embed the code within a CMS, like Drupal, you'll need to modify the code a bit.  See below.

  * Ensure `$STANDALONE_MODE=FALSE` in the config.php
  * Copy the entire contents of config.php into the top of both index.php and gallery.php
  * Rename index.php to something less popular, like albums.php and update the following lines with the new name:
{{{
159:                    echo "<div id='title'><h2>$ALBUM_TITLE</h2></div><p><a class='back_to_list' href='index.php'>...back to album list</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n";
}}}
  * Update all instances of the $action variable in index.php (which you renamed) to point to the embedded or included location of gallery.php.
{{{
23:			$action = "gallery.php";
}}}
 * Update $back_link variable in gallery.php to point to the new name of index.php, for links back to the main page.
{{{
24:		       $back_link="albums.php";
}}}
